//Given a binary tree, find the lowest common ancestor (LCA) of two given nodes
//in the tree.
//
// According to the definition of LCA on Wikipedia: “The lowest common ancestor
//is defined between two nodes p and q as the lowest node in T that has both p and
// q as descendants (where we allow a node to be a descendant of itself).”
//
// Given the following binary tree: root = [3,5,1,6,2,0,8,null,null,7,4]
//
//
//
// Example 1:
//
//
//Input: root = [3,5,1,6,2,0,8,null,null,7,4], p = 5, q = 1
//Output: 3
//Explanation: The LCA of nodes 5 and 1 is 3.
//
//
// Example 2:
//
//
//Input: root = [3,5,1,6,2,0,8,null,null,7,4], p = 5, q = 4
//Output: 5
//Explanation: The LCA of nodes 5 and 4 is 5, since a node can be a descendant o
//f itself according to the LCA definition.
//
//
//
//
// Note:
//
//
// All of the nodes' values will be unique.
// p and q are different and both values will exist in the binary tree.
